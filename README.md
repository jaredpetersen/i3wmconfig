i3wmconfig
==========

This is a simple collection of configuration files for the i3 window manager. These files represent my own setup, and may need to be adjusted to fit your machine's hardware.

Configuring i3
==============

Your best bet for learning how to configure (in some cases "rice") your i3 setup is the i3 User Guide (http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html), "Setting Up My Linux to be Less Ugly" by blogger HNDR (http://hndr.me/blog/making-my-new-linux-less-ugly/), the i3 page on the ArchWiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/i3), and simply Googling.

Configuration File Locations
============================

To configure your i3 setup to be exactly like mine (screenshot coming soon), replace your configuration files with the ones in this repository. The configuration files are located as listed:
- i3:  ~/.i3/config
- i3status: ~/.config/i3status/config

It is important to not that my keybindings may not work for you hardware differences (brightness/audio keybindings), software differences (particularly in the case of feh), or even personal preferences. I heavily recommend that you install feh to manage your desktop background, as that is what I use in this configuration.

TO DO
=====
- Fix keybindings for volume up, down, and mute
- Customize GTK theme
